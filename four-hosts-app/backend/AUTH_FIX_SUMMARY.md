# Authentication Flow Fix Summary

## Issue
The backend was throwing `AttributeError: 'types.SimpleNamespace' object has no attribute 'user_id'` when accessing the `/auth/user` endpoint after a successful token refresh.

## Root Cause
There was a naming inconsistency in the `get_current_user` function in `main.py`:
- The function created a `SimpleNamespace` object with an `id` field
- But the `/auth/user` endpoint was trying to access `current_user.user_id`

## Solution
Updated the `get_current_user` function to include both `id` and `user_id` fields for backward compatibility:

```python
user = SimpleNamespace(
    id=token_data.user_id,
    user_id=token_data.user_id,  # Include both for backward compatibility
    email=token_data.email,
    role=(
        UserRole(token_data.role)
        if isinstance(token_data.role, str)
        else token_data.role
    ),
)
```

## Files Modified
- `/home/azureuser/4hosts/four-hosts-app/backend/main.py` (line 264)

## Testing
Created `test-auth-fix.py` to verify the complete authentication flow:
1. Login
2. Access /auth/user with initial token
3. Refresh token
4. Access /auth/user with refreshed token (this was failing before)
5. Logout
6. Verify access is denied after logout

## To Run Tests
```bash
cd /home/azureuser/4hosts/four-hosts-app/backend
python test-auth-fix.py
```

## Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility by keeping both `id` and `user_id` fields
- Other endpoints that use `current_user.id` will continue to work
- The `/auth/user` endpoint that expects `current_user.user_id` now works correctly
- The logout endpoint uses `get_current_user_optional` which returns `TokenData` directly, so it was not affected
