I'll review the documentation to understand the current state of the application and determine the next steps for moving from MVP to full realization. Let me start by examining the key documentation files. Let me examine the MVP overview and implementation roadmap files more closely: Let me continue reading the MVP Overview document: Let me look at the phased implementation plan to understand the complete roadmap:  Now let me examine the current state of the application to understand what has been implemented: Let me check what else is in the backend file:   Let me check the Phase 1 and 2 performance report to understand what has been completed:  Let me also look at the Architecture Guide to understand the full system design:   Let me look at the API specification to understand the full API surface:    Now let me check the current state of the frontend components:    Based on my review of the documentation and current implementation, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the next steps to move from MVP to full realization:

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Completed (MVP Status)
1. **Basic Classification Engine** - Simple keyword-based classification with ~82% accuracy
2. **Frontend UI** - React app with basic research form, paradigm display, and results display
3. **Backend API** - FastAPI with core endpoints for classification and research submission
4. **Basic Infrastructure** - Local development environment with mock data

### ðŸš§ In Progress/Partially Complete
1. Classification engine uses simple keyword matching instead of the advanced hybrid approach
2. No actual search integration (returns mock data)
3. Missing the W-S-C-I context engineering pipeline
4. No real research execution or synthesis

   - Create saved searches and history
   - Add export functionality (PDF, JSON, CSV)
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Priority 4)
**Timeline: 6 weeks**

1. **Mesh Network Implementation**

## Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Set up development infrastructure**
   - Configure search API credentials
   - Set up cloud development environment
   - Implement proper secrets management
   - Create development/staging/production environments

2. **Begin Phase 3 implementation**
