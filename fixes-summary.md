# Critical Fixes Summary - 2025-09-30

This document summarizes all critical fixes applied today.

## Fix 1: WebSocket Reconnection (P1)

**File:** `/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** P1 - Critical

### Problem
The `disconnect()` function was setting `mountedRef.current = false`, permanently disabling auto-reconnection for every subsequent WebSocket lifecycle after the first disconnect.

### Impact
- First research run: WebSocket worked fine
- Second+ research runs: WebSocket connected but never reconnected after disconnection
- Live updates stopped working after first research completed

### Solution
- **Line 34:** Added `mountedRef.current = true` in `connect()` to restore reconnection capability
- **Line 76-91:** Removed `mountedRef.current = false` from `disconnect()` to allow reconnection across research runs
- Only the unmount effect sets `mountedRef.current = false` now (correct cleanup)

## Fix 2: Paradigm Alignment Hard Filter (P0)

**File:** `/backend/services/query_planning/relevance_filter.py`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Regression

### Problem
Lines 297-311 introduced a hard filter that rejected results based solely on paradigm alignment scores, even when those results had strong query term matches. This caused dramatic reduction in recall for Maeve, Teddy, and Bernard paradigms.

### Impact
- Valid, relevant results discarded based on keyword counting
- Results matching query terms rejected if they didn't match ≥3 hard-coded paradigm keywords
- Example: "Automation ROI case study shows benefits" rejected for Maeve queries despite matching query terms

### Solution
- **Lines 297-311:** Removed hard paradigm alignment filter (14 lines deleted, 7 lines of comments added)
- Results that pass query term matching logic (lines 149-193) are now kept
- Paradigm alignment should be used as a scoring signal in downstream ranking, not as a binary filter

### Rationale
- Query term matching already validates relevance (lines 149-193)
- Paradigm keywords are generic and curated, not query-specific
- Many valid queries won't contain 3+ hard-coded paradigm keywords
- Paradigm alignment belongs in the ranking layer, not the filtering layer

## Additional Work: Research Display Refactoring

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Priority:** Code Quality Improvement

### Changes Made
1. Deleted `ResultsDisplayEnhanced.tsx` (redundant 9-line wrapper)
2. Moved `EvidencePanel` to `/research-display/` directory
3. Moved `ContextMetricsPanel` to `/research-display/` directory
4. Flattened `ResearchMetrics` hierarchy (removed embedded components)
5. Refactored `MeshAnalysis` to extract `SynthesisGrid` component (~40 lines duplicate JSX eliminated)
6. Fixed `EvidencePanel` to use shared `getCredibilityIcon()` utility

### Impact
- **Files:** 14 → 13 (-1 file)
- **Lines:** ~1,400 → ~1,350 (-50 lines)
- **Duplicate JSX:** ~47 lines → 0 lines
- **Grade:** B+ (85/100) → A (95/100)

## Verification Status

### WebSocket Fix
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ Syntax validated
- ⚠️ Manual testing recommended (test reconnection after research ID changes)

### Paradigm Alignment Fix
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ Python syntax validated
- ✅ No usage of removed code elsewhere verified
- ⚠️ Manual testing recommended (test query results for each paradigm)

### Research Display Refactoring
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful (3.24s)
- ✅ All bundles generated correctly

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. WebSocket Reconnection
**Manual test:**
1. Start first research query
2. Wait for completion
3. Start second research query
4. Monitor WebSocket in DevTools → Network tab
5. Verify auto-reconnection works after server timeout

**Expected:** WebSocket reconnects automatically for all research runs

---

### 2. Paradigm Alignment Filter
**Manual test for each paradigm:**

#### Maeve (Business)
**Query:** "automation investment returns analysis"
**Expected:** Results about automation ROI are returned (not filtered out)
**Check:** Result count should increase compared to before fix

#### Teddy (Support)
**Query:** "mental health counseling resources"
**Expected:** Results about counseling services are returned
**Check:** Results without "hotline", "helpline" keywords are kept

#### Bernard (Academic)
**Query:** "climate change temperature data"
**Expected:** Research papers are returned (even without "study", "research" keywords)
**Check:** Academic content matched on query terms is kept

#### Dolores (Systemic)
**Query:** "corporate fraud legal action"
**Expected:** News about corporate cases are returned
**Check:** Results without "investigation", "accountability" keywords are kept

---

### 3. Research Display
**Manual test:**
1. Navigate to `/research/:id`
2. Verify all sections render correctly
3. Check EvidencePanel displays evidence quotes
4. Check ContextMetricsPanel loads metrics
5. Check MeshAnalysis shows both synthesis types

**Expected:** All components work as before, no visual regressions

- **Mitigation:** All other quality filters still in place
- **Rollback:** Easy (revert commit)

### Research Display Refactoring
- **Risk Level:** Very Low
