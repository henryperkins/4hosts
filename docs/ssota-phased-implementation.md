### Phase 4 — Synthesis & Presentation (6 weeks)
- Deliverables:  
  - [ ] Synthesis engine  
  - [ ] Paradigm templates  
  - [ ] Citation management  
  - [ ] Multi‑paradigm integration  
  - [ ] Exports (PDF/MD/JSON)  
- Exit: relevance ≥ target; 100% citation formatting; generation time within budget.

### Phase 5 — Web App & API (8 weeks)
- Deliverables:  
  - [ ] React/TS UI  
  - [ ] REST API  
  - [ ] Real‑time updates  
  - [ ] Auth + admin basics  
  - [ ] API + UX docs  
- Exit: page load <2s; API P95 <500ms; a11y standards met.

### Phase 6 — Advanced Features (6 weeks)
- Deliverables:  
  - [ ] Self‑healing triggers & evaluation  
  - [ ] Mesh orchestration  
  - [ ] Learning/prefs + feedback loop  
  - [ ] Analytics + A/B testing  
- Exit: switch accuracy ≥ target; mesh value‑add ≥ target; learning uplift measurable.

### Phase 7 — Scale & Optimize (4 weeks)
- Deliverables:  
  - [ ] K8s deploy + autoscaling  
  - [ ] CDN  
  - [ ] Security hardening + audit  
  - [ ] Load/chaos tests  
  - [ ] DR plan  
- Exit: 10k concurrent; internal P95 <100ms; uptime SLO ready.

### Phase 8 — Launch & Iterate (4 weeks)
- Deliverables:  
  - [ ] Beta → soft/public launch  
  - [ ] Feedback → iteration  
  - [ ] Support readiness  
  - [ ] Marketing collateral  
- Exit: satisfaction/retention thresholds met; stability under load; cost controls effective.

## MVP Definition (Month ~6)

Included:  
- Classification for all four paradigms, simplified W‑S‑C‑I, two search APIs, basic credibility + dedupe + caching, paradigm answer templates, citations, simple UI, core API, single‑region deploy and basic monitoring.

Excluded (post‑MVP):  
- Self‑healing, mesh, learning, analytics, enterprise features, advanced caching/multi‑region, multi‑language, collaboration.

MVP Targets (as documented):  
- Accuracy ≥80%, P95 ≤15s including search, >50 sources/query analyzed on average (depth‑dependent), user satisfaction ≥75%, cost/query <$0.25 (config‑dependent).

Context budgets (MVP):
- Max prompt tokens per step; max memory growth per session; periodic trimming target and alerting.

---

## Checkpoints (Go/No‑Go)

Checkpoint 1 (End Phase 2): continue to Research Execution?  
- Go: accuracy ≥75% (target 80%), W‑S‑C‑I <2s, team staffed, burn rate within 10%, no critical blockers.  
- No‑Go: accuracy <60%, concept flaw, key lead loss, >25% overrun.  
- Pivots: fewer paradigms, timeline extension, partner for search.

Checkpoint 2 (MVP Complete): proceed to Beta?  
- Go: all MVP features, P95 <15s, 100 concurrent, internal satisfaction >80%, <$0.30/query, ≥50 alpha users.  
- Pivots: reduce search depth, single‑paradigm launch, API‑only beta.

Operational note: when P95 is exceeded due to external search latency, enable progressive loading and fall back to cached partial results with clear UI status.

Checkpoint 3 (Beta): scale to public?  
- Go: ≥500 beta users, satisfaction ≥75%, W2 retention ≥40%, paradigm acceptance ≥80%, NPS ≥50, monetization signal, infra stable at 1k users.  
- Pivots: extend beta with UX work, niche focus, enterprise pivot, open‑source core.

Checkpoint 4 (Public Launch Ready): full launch?  
- Go: 10k capacity, 99.9% uptime, support ready, legal compliance, marketing, funding or profitability path.

## Risks & Mitigations (condensed)

- LLM/Search Reliability → multi‑provider fallback, caching, depth controls.  
- Costs → aggressive caching, configurable depth, quota guards.  
- Classification Accuracy → continuous learning, override UX, dataset expansion.  
- Security/Privacy → JWT scopes, rate limits, PI handling, SSRF/prompt‑injection awareness.  
- Adoption → strong beta, differentiation via paradigms, tight UX loop.

Observability hooks by phase:

- P0–P2: classification accuracy dashboard; W‑S‑C‑I timings; cache hit rates.  
- P3–P4: search latency/coverage/credibility; citation correctness checks.  
- P5–P8: end‑to‑end P95, user satisfaction/overrides, cost/query, error budget burn.

---

## Success Metrics (roll‑up)

- Quality: accuracy, citation correctness, user satisfaction, time to valuable insight.  
- Performance: classification/W‑S‑C‑I latency, search latency, cache hit rates, error rate.  
- Product: paradigm override frequency, exports, retention, monetization signal.  
- Ops: availability, cost/query, scalability headroom.

Context metrics:
- Average tokens injected per step and per phase; trimming ratio.  
- Detected conflicts and resolution rate.  
- Quarantined tool outputs and verification pass rate.

This phased guide is a normalization of the existing plan, MVP, Go/No‑Go, risk, and performance materials in this folder. Treat numeric values as targets or prototype‑benchmarks where so indicated in the source docs.
