## Risk Response Strategies

### 1. Weekly Risk Review Process

```
Every Friday:
1. Review risk register
2. Update probabilities
3. Check trigger conditions
4. Assign risk owners
5. Document new risks
```

### 2. Escalation Matrix

|Risk Level|Response Time|Decision Maker|Action|
|---|---|---|---|
|ðŸ”´ Critical|Immediate|CEO/CTO|War room activation|
|ðŸŸ  High|24 hours|Project Manager|Team meeting called|
|ðŸŸ¡ Medium|1 week|Team Lead|Mitigation planned|
|ðŸŸ¢ Low|2 weeks|Individual|Monitor only|

### 3. Risk Budget Allocation

- **Technical Risks**: 40% of contingency
- **Business Risks**: 30% of contingency
- **Operational Risks**: 20% of contingency
- **Unknown Risks**: 10% of contingency

## Conclusion

The highest risks to the project are:

1. **Search API costs** (Critical)
2. **User adoption** (Critical)
3. **LLM reliability** (High)
4. **Competition** (High)

By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above and maintaining vigilant monitoring, these risks can be managed effectively. The key is early detection through our warning indicators and swift response through our escalation matrix.

**Remember**: Risk management is not about eliminating all risks, but about informed decision-making and prepared responses.
