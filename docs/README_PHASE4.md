## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

No new dependencies required - Phase 4 uses existing packages:
- `openai` and `anthropic` for future LLM integration
- `tenacity` for retry logic (already installed)

### 2. Configure LLM APIs (Optional)

```bash
# Add to .env for LLM synthesis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Answer Generation System

```bash
python test_answer_generation.py
```

### 4. Run the Complete System

```bash
# Start Redis (required for caching)
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Run the API with Phase 4 integration
python main_updated.py
```
