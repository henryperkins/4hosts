## Summary

I've created a comprehensive outline for a Four Hosts Agentic Research Web Application that combines the Westworld consciousness paradigms with practical web research capabilities. Here's what I've delivered:

### 1. **System Design Document**

A complete architecture showing how user queries flow through:

- Paradigm Classification (determining which "host" approach to use)
- Context Engineering Pipeline (Write-Select-Compress-Isolate layers)
- Research Execution (paradigm-specific web searches)
- Synthesis & Presentation (paradigm-appropriate answers)

### 2. **Technical Flow Diagram**

A visual representation showing a real example ("How can small businesses compete with Amazon?") moving through the entire system, demonstrating how MAEVE (strategic) paradigm shapes every step of the research process.

### 3. **Implementation Code**

A working Python prototype showing:

- Paradigm classification based on query keywords
- Context engineering with paradigm-specific strategies
- Mock search execution
- Answer synthesis in paradigm-appropriate format

### 4. **API Specification**

Complete RESTful API documentation with:

- 10 core endpoints for research, paradigm management, and user preferences
- Webhook events for real-time updates
- Rate limiting and authentication
- SDK examples

### 5. **Paradigm Comparison**

A detailed example showing how the same query ("How can we address homelessness?") produces completely different research approaches through each paradigm lens.

## Key Innovation

The system's core innovation is recognizing that different questions require different research approaches:

- **DOLORES** (Revolutionary): Uncovers systemic injustices, perfect for exposing wrongdoing
- **TEDDY** (Devotion): Focuses on care and protection, ideal for community support questions
- **BERNARD** (Analytical): Provides objective analysis, best for data-driven inquiries
- **MAEVE** (Strategic): Delivers actionable strategies, optimal for competitive/influence questions

By automatically classifying queries and adapting the entire research pipeline accordingly, the system provides more contextually appropriate and effective answers than traditional search engines.

The application includes self-healing mechanisms (switching paradigms if one isn't working), mesh network integration (combining multiple paradigms when needed), and learning capabilities to improve over time.

This creates a truly "conscious" research system that doesn't just find information but understands the intent behind queries and adapts its entire approach to serve that intent most effectively.
