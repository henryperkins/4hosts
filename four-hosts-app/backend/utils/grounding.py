"""grounding.py â€“ Lightweight grounding coverage helper

The heuristic measures how well the generated answer references evidence
by computing the ratio of answer sentences that include at least one
citation marker (URL, ID, or title snippet).  The computation is kept
simple and dependency-free to avoid adding heavy NLP libraries.
