# Research Process Stop Issue - Analysis & Fixes

## Issue Summary
The research process is stopping due to errors in the backend `/v1/research/query` endpoint, specifically in the `execute_real_research` function in `routes/research.py`.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Import for log_exception
- **Location**: `four-hosts-app/backend/routes/research.py:188`
- **Error**: `NameError: name 'log_exception' is not defined`
- **Cause**: The `log_exception` function from `utils.error_handling` is not imported

### 2. Type Mismatch in Classification Details Parsing
- **Location**: `four-hosts-app/backend/routes/research.py:169`
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'`
- **Cause**: The code expects `pc` (paradigm_classification) to be a dict but it's sometimes a string
- **Specific Issue**: `pc.get("primary")` fails when `pc` is a string instead of a dict

## Impact
When a research query is submitted:
1. The classification process succeeds
2. The research orchestration begins
3. The process fails during metadata handling
4. Error handling also fails due to missing import
5. WebSocket disconnects immediately
6. Frontend shows incomplete/failed research

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Missing Import
```python
# Add to imports section (around line 49)
from utils.error_handling import log_exception
```

### Fix 2: Handle Type Variations in Classification Data
```python
# Replace lines 168-169 with proper type checking
if isinstance(pc, dict):
    primary_data = pc.get("primary")
    if isinstance(primary_data, dict):
        primary_ui = primary_data.get("paradigm")
    else:
        primary_ui = None
elif isinstance(pc, str):
    # Handle string case - may be a paradigm name directly
    primary_ui = pc
else:
    primary_ui = None
```

## Additional Observations

1. **Frontend Error**: `/v1/feedback/classification` endpoint returns 404, suggesting this endpoint doesn't exist or isn't properly routed
2. **Health Checks**: All containers are healthy and running
3. **Authentication**: JWT auth is working correctly
4. **WebSocket**: Connection establishes but disconnects immediately after error

## Verification Steps After Fix
1. Check imports are properly added
2. Test with various research queries
3. Monitor logs for any remaining errors
4. Verify WebSocket stays connected during research
5. Confirm results are properly displayed in frontend

## Prevention
1. Add proper type validation for stored data
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add unit tests for edge cases in classification data handling
4. Consider using Pydantic models for stricter type validation
