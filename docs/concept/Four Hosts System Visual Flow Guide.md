## 💡 System Intelligence Demonstrated

The system correctly identified this as a **strategic business query** (MAEVE) while recognizing the **anti-monopoly sentiment** (DOLORES). This dual recognition led to:

1. Primary focus on competitive strategies and tactics
2. Secondary inclusion of monopoly/antitrust angles
3. Balanced search query generation
4. Appropriate compression for actionable business intelligence

This demonstrates the system's ability to handle nuanced, multi-paradigm queries effectively.
