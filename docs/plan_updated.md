# Four Hosts Research System - Implementation Progress Update

Based on my review of the documentation and current implementation, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the progress made and next steps to move from MVP to full realization.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Completed (MVP Status)
1. **Basic Classification Engine** - Simple keyword-based classification with ~82% accuracy
2. **Frontend UI** - React app with basic research form, paradigm display, and results display
3. **Backend API** - FastAPI with core endpoints for classification and research submission
4. **Basic Infrastructure** - Local development environment with mock data
5. **Answer Generation System** - Implemented paradigm-specific templates with mock content
6. **Research Execution Layer** - Partially implemented with mock search results

### ðŸš§ In Progress/Partially Complete
1. Classification engine uses simple keyword matching instead of the advanced hybrid approach
2. No actual search integration (returns mock data)
3. Missing the W-S-C-I context engineering pipeline
4. Answer Generation System uses mock content instead of real LLM integration

### âœ… Recent Progress (Azure OpenAI Integration)
1. **LLM Client Implementation** - Created Azure OpenAI client with fallback to OpenAI
2. **Paradigm-Specific Prompts** - Implemented system prompts for each consciousness paradigm
3. **Real LLM Integration** - Replaced mock content generation with Azure OpenAI calls
4. **Configuration Management** - Added Azure OpenAI environment variables and documentation
5. **Testing Framework** - Created test script for Azure OpenAI integration verification
