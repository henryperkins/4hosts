# Agentic Research Workflow - Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of quick wins and improvements based on the agentic research workflow remediation plan for the Four Hosts Research Application.

## Completed Quick Wins (Stage 3-5)

### Stage 3: Source Discovery ✅

#### Query Diversification (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: Only 3 query variations (primary, semantic, question)
- **After**: 5-7 variations including:
  - Synonym expansion using WordNet
  - Related concepts mapping
  - Domain-specific terminology
  - Different phrasing styles
  - Academic vs colloquial variations

#### Authority Scoring (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: Basic domain checking (.gov, .edu, .org)
- **After**: 
  - Configurable whitelists/blacklists in SearchConfig
  - Tiered authority scoring by source type
  - Primary source identification
  - Credible news source recognition

### Stage 4: Retrieval and Collection ✅

#### Enhanced Metadata Schema (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: Basic fields (title, url, snippet, source)
- **After**: Added:
  - Author information
  - Publication type classification
  - Citation count for academic papers
  - Content length tracking
  - Last modified date
  - Content hash for deduplication

#### Improved Deduplication (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: No deduplication
- **After**:
  - MD5 content hashing
  - Near-duplicate detection (85% Jaccard similarity)
  - Cross-API deduplication
  - Preserves highest quality version

### Stage 5: Credibility Assessment ✅

#### Comprehensive Credibility Features (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: Simple domain authority and bias detection
- **After**:
  - Recency decay modeling (exponential)
  - Cross-source agreement scoring
  - Controversy detection and scoring
  - Update frequency tracking
  - Social proof metrics (placeholder)

#### Enhanced Source Database (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: ~20 hardcoded sources
- **After**:
  - 50+ sources with detailed metadata
  - Source categorization (news, academic, blog, social)
  - Update frequency patterns
  - Topic-specific credibility potential

#### Controversy Detection (COMPLETED)
- **New Feature**: ControversyDetector class
  - Identifies controversial topics
  - Tracks conflicting viewpoints
  - Calculates controversy scores
  - Paradigm-aware adjustments

#### Credibility Cards (COMPLETED)
- **New Feature**: Structured credibility assessments
  - Visual trust levels
  - Key reputation factors
  - Paradigm alignment scores
  - Usage recommendations

## Remaining Roadmap Items

### Phase 1: Additional Retrieval Improvements (Weeks 2-6)
- [ ] Implement respectful rate limiting with exponential backoff across all APIs
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns for all external services
- [ ] Implement adaptive chunking based on content type
- [ ] Add specialized parsers for different content formats

### Phase 2: Orchestration and Evaluation (Weeks 6-10)
- [ ] Build budget-aware planner with tool registry
- [ ] Implement separate evaluator agents
- [ ] Create rubric-based scoring system
- [ ] Add observability dashboards for monitoring

### Phase 3: Evidence Graph (Quarter 2)
- [ ] Build evidence/argument graph structure
- [ ] Implement contradiction detection across sources
- [ ] Add uncertainty quantification
- [ ] Create interactive exploration UI

### Phase 4: Knowledge Systems (Quarter 3)
- [ ] Implement research store with embeddings
- [ ] Add automated retrospectives
- [ ] Build knowledge graph integration
- [ ] Create continuous improvement loops

## Integration Points

### Current Implementation Files:
1. `search_apis.py` - Enhanced with query diversification, metadata, deduplication
2. `credibility.py` - Enhanced with comprehensive scoring, controversy detection
3. `paradigm_search.py` - Ready for integration with new features

### Next Steps for Integration:
1. Update `research_orchestrator.py` to use enhanced search features
2. Modify `answer_generator.py` to incorporate credibility cards
3. Update frontend to display credibility assessments
4. Add monitoring for new metrics (controversy, agreement, etc.)

## Performance Metrics to Track

### Quality Metrics:
- Groundedness score (% claims with citations)
- Citation coverage and density
- Contradiction detection rate
- Cross-source agreement percentage

### Efficiency Metrics:
- Query variation effectiveness
- Deduplication rate
- Cache hit rate
- API failure/retry rates

### User Satisfaction:
- Result relevance scores
- Credibility assessment accuracy
- Time to first insight
- User trust ratings

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for all new functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test cross-API deduplication
3. **Paradigm Tests**: Verify paradigm-specific behaviors
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure impact of new features
5. **User Studies**: Validate credibility card effectiveness

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **Whitelist/Blacklist Management**: Implement admin controls
2. **Content Hashing**: Ensure no PII in hashes
3. **Controversy Detection**: Handle sensitive topics carefully
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse while maintaining service

## Conclusion

The quick wins from the agentic research workflow remediation plan have been successfully implemented for Stages 3-5. The search and credibility systems now have:
- Better query coverage through diversification
- More accurate source assessment
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Effective deduplication
- Nuanced credibility scoring
- Controversy awareness

These improvements provide a solid foundation for the remaining phases of the remediation plan, setting up the Four Hosts application for more reliable, transparent, and effective research capabilities.
