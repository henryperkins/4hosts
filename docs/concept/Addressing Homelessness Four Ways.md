## Key Insight: Paradigm Selection Matters

The same query produces fundamentally different research approaches:

- **Dolores** seeks to overturn the system
- **Teddy** seeks to heal individuals
- **Bernard** seeks to understand patterns
- **Maeve** seeks to control outcomes

**None is "wrong"** - but each serves different purposes and stakeholders. The most powerful solutions often require conscious integration of all four perspectives.
