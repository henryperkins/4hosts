Of course. The existing plan is a high-level roadmap. To fully implement the complex, AI-driven logic from the design documents, a more detailed
  engineering plan is required.

  Here is a new plan focused on upgrading the core application logic from its current MVP state to the advanced, feature-rich system described in the
  documentation.

  Plan: Upgrading to Advanced AI Core

  This plan outlines the steps to replace the current basic classification and mock research pipeline with the advanced, AI-powered Classification Engine
  and Context Engineering Pipeline.

  Phase 1: Implement the Advanced Classification Engine

  Goal: Replace the basic keyword classifier with the hybrid rule-based/LLM engine to achieve >85% accuracy and detailed query understanding.

  Timeline: 3 weeks

   1. Create `classification_engine.py`:
       * Establish a new service file: four-hosts-app/backend/services/classification_engine.py.
       * Define the core data structures (QueryFeatures, ParadigmScore, ClassificationResult) as specified in Four Hosts Classification Engine Core.md.

   2. Build the `QueryAnalyzer`:
       * Implement comprehensive feature extraction:
           * Tokenization, entity recognition (using a library like spaCy or NLTK if available, otherwise regex-based).
           * Intent signal detection.
           * Domain identification.
           * Scoring for urgency, complexity, and emotional valence.
       * Incorporate the detailed keyword and pattern mappings from the documentation.

   3. Develop the Hybrid `ParadigmClassifier`:
       * Implement the rule-based scoring logic based on the features from the QueryAnalyzer.
       * Integrate with the existing llm_client to add an LLM-based scoring layer.
       * Implement the weighted combination logic (rule_weight, llm_weight) to produce a final, hybrid score.
       * Add the confidence calculation algorithm.

   4. Write Unit Tests:
       * Create tests/test_classification_engine.py to validate the accuracy and performance of the new engine against a diverse set of test queries.

  Phase 2: Implement the Context Engineering Pipeline

  Goal: Build the full W-S-C-I (Write-Select-Compress-Isolate) pipeline to transform a classified query into a rich, paradigm-aware research strategy.

  Timeline: 3 weeks

   1. Create `context_engineering.py`:
       * Establish a new service file: four-hosts-app/backend/services/context_engineering.py.
       * Define the pipeline's data models (WriteLayerOutput, SelectLayerOutput, etc.) as specified in Four Hosts Context Engineering Pipeline.md.

   2. Implement W-S-C-I Layers:
       * Write Layer: Implement logic to define the documentation focus, key themes, and search priorities based on the classified paradigm.
       * Select Layer: Implement logic to generate a list of modified, enhanced search queries and select appropriate source types and tools.
       * Compress Layer: Implement logic to set paradigm-specific compression ratios, token budgets, and define priority elements for summarization.
       * Isolate Layer: Implement logic to define the key finding criteria and output structure for the final synthesis phase.

   3. Build the Pipeline Orchestrator:
       * Create the main ContextEngineeringPipeline class that processes a ClassificationResult through all four layers in sequence.

   4. Write Unit Tests:
       * Create tests/test_context_engineering.py to ensure each layer correctly modifies the input based on the paradigm.

  Phase 3: Integrate Advanced Services into the Application

  Goal: Rewire the main application flow to use the new advanced services, connecting them to the existing research and answer generation layers.

  Timeline: 2 weeks

   1. Update the Main Research Flow:
       * In main.py (or main_updated.py), modify the primary /research/query endpoint.
       * Replace the call to the basic classifier with a call to the new ClassificationEngine.
       * Add a call to the new ContextEngineeringPipeline, passing the result from the classification engine.

   2. Refactor the `ResearchOrchestrator`:
       * Modify research_orchestrator.py to accept the ContextEngineeredQuery object as its primary input.
       * Update the execute_paradigm_research method to use the detailed search queries and source preferences generated by the SelectLayer.

   3. Refactor the `AnswerGenerationOrchestrator`:
       * Modify answer_generator_continued.py to accept the ContextEngineeredQuery object.
       * Update the generate_answer method to use the CompressLayer and IsolateLayer outputs to guide the final synthesis.

   4. Update Data Models and Storage:
       * Modify the application's central Research status model to store the detailed outputs from the new classification and context engineering steps
         for logging and debugging.

   5. Create Integration Tests:
       * Update tests/verify_integration.py to test the full, end-to-end flow from query to final answer, ensuring all new components work together
         correctly.

  This plan provides a concrete path to realizing the sophisticated AI architecture you've designed. Shall I begin with Phase 1, Task 1.1: Creating the
  classification_engine.py file?

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > begin with phase 1, first reviewing the current implemntation deeply  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Understood. I will begin Phase 1 by deeply reviewing the current classification implementation.

  First, I'll search the backend source code for terms related to classification like "classify" and "paradigm" to locate the relevant files.
✦ The search results confirm that the current classification logic is located entirely within main.py.

  Specifically, the function classify_query(query: str) -> ParadigmClassification: (line 917) contains the simple keyword-matching implementation.

  Here's a deep dive into the current implementation:

   1. Location: main.py, lines 917-960.
   2. Logic:
       * It defines a dictionary paradigm_keywords mapping each of the four paradigms to a list of about 8 keywords.
       * It iterates through the keywords for each paradigm and increments a score by 1.0 for each match found in the lowercased query.
       * It calculates a simple probability distribution based on the raw scores.
       * It determines the primary and secondary paradigms by sorting the scores. It defaults to "bernard" if no keywords are matched.
       * It calculates a confidence score, which is a simple calculation based on the highest score's proportion of the total, capped between 50% and
         95%.
       * It returns a ParadigmClassification object.
   3. Integration:
       * The classify_query function is called directly by the /research/query endpoint (line 629) and the /paradigms/classify endpoint (line 590).
       * The result is immediately used to generate mock paradigm-specific search queries via generate_paradigm_queries (line 1037) and to populate the
         paradigm_analysis section of the research result.
       * There is no complex context engineering. The classification directly feeds into a simple query generator and the final (mock) answer synthesis.

  Conclusion:

  The current implementation is a straightforward, self-contained function within main.py. It serves as a good placeholder but lacks the sophistication
  outlined in the design documents. It does not analyze query features like intent, domain, or complexity, and its keyword lists are limited.

  Now that I have a clear understanding of the existing system, I will proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.1: creating the new, more advanced
  classification_engine.py file. This new module will contain the logic to eventually replace the simple classify_query function.
✦ I have created the initial structure for the classification_engine.py file. This file includes the data classes and placeholders for the QueryAnalyzer
  and ParadigmClassifier as outlined in the plan.

  Next, I will implement the QueryAnalyzer class with the full feature extraction logic from the Four Hosts Classification Engine Core.md document. This
  will involve adding the comprehensive keyword mappings, pattern matching, and scoring functions.
✦ I have now implemented the QueryAnalyzer class.

  Next, I will implement the ParadigmClassifier class. This class will use the features extracted by the QueryAnalyzer to score each paradigm, combine
  rule-based and LLM-based scores (when available), and ultimately produce a ClassificationResult.
